### WHAT IS THIS?
This is a tool for converting a .xlsx file to a .csv file which can be imported as a database into the iFix program

### UI
you will have 2 buttons (on which it says what they are for) and a field with a number 0, replace ths number with the number of rows you have in your .xlsx file (do not count the line wiht column names)

#### POSSIBLE ERRORS:
<br></ pleas make shore that the column names in your .xlsx file are the same as they are in the iFix program (you can look through the specific types' JSON file to make shore they are the same)
<br></ check how the I/O address is typed for DI, DO and AI, AO (byt:bit / byt)
<br></ for any other problem pleas do make an issue
<br></ make shore that in your .xlsx document the TYPES are in order (eg: AI,AI,DI,DO... and not AI,DI,AI,DO,AO,DO...)
<br><br>! only thing (at the moment) is that if you mess up the file selection you need to restart the program !
