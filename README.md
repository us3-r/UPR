## BEFORE FIRST USE

Before you first run the program you need to remove a few things:
<br>- in **default.json** remove the first tree line ("sim":"", "tag":"","name":"") 


### TODO
- make so all values with the same BLOCK_TYPE are written under same line
- use different json object based on the BLOCK_TYPE [ eg: if BLOCK_TYPE is "AI" then use "AI:{}" ]
- ~~add text bellow the list of titles [ dont know what it is ]~~  DONE
- ~~fix the position of values [ eg: values in table get infront of the valus in .json >> can lead to conversion errors ]~~ DONE
